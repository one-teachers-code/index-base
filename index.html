  <h1>Hello World!</h1>

  <!-- Notice how everything between the <h1> opening tag and </h1> closing tag is
    in big writing. This is because the two tags tell the computer that everything in between is
    a heading. Same with the p tags below, which tell the computer that everything is a paragraph. -->

  <p> This is a basic webpage. It contains a heading, a paragraph, 
      and links to a stylesheet (main.css) which is another
      file that controls things like colour and position. </p>

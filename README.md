# index-base

These two files (index.html and main.css) are just to get you started when you create a website. You can download them into a folder on your computer, then open them in your code editor (e.g. Brackets or Notepad++). To see the website, you can open index.html in your browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, Safari). Feel free to delete the comments.
